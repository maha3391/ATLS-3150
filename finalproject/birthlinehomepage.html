            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>the <strong>vision</strong> of a community where mothers and couples of unintended pregnancies are themselves loved and supported so much that they <strong>all</strong> choose to bring their babies to term, and all might thrive in their new life together</li>
                <li>the <strong>mission</strong> of offering real support to expecting mothers and couples from the time of their baby’s conception and throughout the young parental years, so as to safeguard the lives of born and unborn children and to open doors to gospel conversations</li>
                <li>the emphasized Christian <strong>values</strong> of non-judgmental <strong><em>compassion</em></strong>, unwavering <strong><em>forthrightness</em></strong>, and covenantal <strong><em>commitment</em></strong> to those whom we are blessed and fortunate enough to serve.</li>
            </ul>
