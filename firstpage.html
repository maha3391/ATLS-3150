    <h1>Assignment 6: Fly Tying</h1>
    <p>
      I've recently begun exploring the art of <strong>fly tying</strong>. 
      I have only tied <strong>elk hair caddis</strong> and <strong>parachute adams</strong> thus far. 
      These two fly patterns are classified as "dry" or "top water" because they are supposed to float on the surface of the water.
      There are other patterns classified as "wet" or "sub water" because they are supposed to sink below the surface.

      My favorite youtube channel to learn fly tying is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@venturesflyco"> Ventures Fly Co</a>.
      There is also a helpful site called <a href=https://www.troutandfeather.com/fly-tying-techniques?srsltid=AfmBOoorHHYFe081uTwwukQb6JHXuh2ZK6CA3D1CYBW94e6_PFHRekC7> Trout and Feather </a> that focuses on techniques and materials.
